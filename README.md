Hi, I'm a Data Scientist with a long experience as a freelance engineer in applied science.

Here you will find the projects I worked on during my studies as a data scientist. 

Note that all project had limited time to be achieved and different goal, they're meant for practice. Therefore, some may look unfinished or some parts 
may be overlooked because they were practiced with more dedication on another project.
